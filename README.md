# Clustering_Algorithms

Clustering or cluster analysis is an unsupervised learning problem.
It is often used as a data analysis technique for discovering interesting patterns in data, such as groups of customers based on their behavior.
There are many clustering algorithms to choose from and no single best clustering algorithm for all cases. Instead, it is a good idea to explore a range of clustering algorithms and different configurations for each algorithm.
